# Rekall Corporation - Capture the Flag (CTF) Web Application Exploitation

## Overview
This project involves exploiting vulnerabilities within the fictional organization Rekall Corporation's web application. The objective is to discover and exploit vulnerabilities in the system to capture flags in a Capture the Flag (CTF)-style competition. This project will utilize the skills learned in the Offensive Security unit, focusing on web application security.

## Project Objectives
- **Reconnaissance**: Gather information about the organization's web application to understand its structure and potential weaknesses.
- **Web Application Scanning**: Identify common vulnerabilities in the web application (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, file upload vulnerabilities).
- **Exploitation**: Attempt to exploit the discovered vulnerabilities to capture flags.
- **Privilege Escalation**: Test for potential privilege escalation opportunities within the application.
- **Post-Exploitation**: Analyze the system after exploiting the vulnerabilities for any further flags or access.

# Day 1 - Capture the Flag (CTF) Web Application Exploitation 

## Overview
Today, you'll begin your second project. In this project, you'll use the skills that you learned in the Offensive Security unit to attack a fictional organization, Rekall Corporation, and determine its vulnerabilities. As you do so, you will look for "flags" within the organization's web application and operating systems that you'll collect in a competition-style Capture the Flag (CTF) game. Today, you will attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in the organization's web application.

## Objectives for Day 1
- **Reconnaissance**: Gather information about the web application to understand its structure and possible attack surfaces.
- **Identify Vulnerabilities**: Look for common vulnerabilities in the web application using tools like Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, and manual inspection.
- **Capture Flags**: Exploit the vulnerabilities to capture the hidden flags within the application.

# Day 2 - Capture the Flag (CTF) Linux Server Exploitation

## Overview
In today's class, you will continue to exploit Rekall's technical infrastructure, but today you'll focus on Rekall's Linux servers and vulnerabilities related to Linux operating systems. You will continue finding flags during your exploitation.

## Objectives for Day 2
- **Reconnaissance**: This category contains challenges that use open source intelligence tools.
- **Scanning**: This category contains challenges that use scanning tools, such as Nmap and Nessus.
- **Exploitation**: This category contains challenges that use exploitation tools, such as Metasploit.
- **Post Exploitation**: This category contains challenges that use post-exploitation tools, such as Meterpreter.

# Day 3 - Capture the Flag (CTF) Windows Server Exploitation 

## Overview
In today's class you will continue to exploit Rekall's technical infrastructure, but today you'll focus on Rekall's Windows servers and vulnerabilities related to Windows operating systems. You will continue finding flags during your exploitation.

## Objectives for Day 3
- **Reconnaissance**: This category contains challenges that use open source intelligence tools.
- **Scanning**: This category contains challenges that use scanning tools, such as Nmap and Nessus.
- **Exploitation**: This category contains challenges that use exploitation tools, such as Metasploit.
- **Post Exploitation**: This category contains challenges that use post-exploitation tools, such as Meterpreter.
